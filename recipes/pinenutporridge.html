    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        I think that pine nut porridge is the queen of all the porridges! Beautifully white, mild in taste, warm and satisfying, I’ve never seen anybody who doesn’t like this porridge. The recipe is also very simple, made with just a few ingredients, and it’s super-nutritious! Pine nuts contain lots of protein, iron, magnesium, and are good to increase your energy level. They are made with a combination of protein, fiber, and healthy fats that are good for you</p>

    <p><h3>Ingredients</h3></p>
    <p><ul>
        <li>1lb thin boneless pork chops</li>
        <li>thai rice noodles</li>
        <li>cilantro</li>
        <li>green beans</li>
        <li>zest & juice of 1 lime</li>
        <li>ginger</li>
        <li>garlic</li>
        <li>red (or green) jalapeño peppers</li>
        <li>shallots</li>
        <li>fish sauce</li>
        <li>light brown sugar</li>
        <li>peanut oil</li>
    </ul></p>
    <p><h3>Directions</h3></p>
    <p><ol>
        <li><strong>Step 1: </strong> Place the pork in the freezer about 10 minutes to make it easier to slice. Soak the noodles in very hot water until just tender, about 10 minutes; drain. Snip the noodles with scissors into shorter lengths. Cut the frozen pork crosswise into 1/4-inch-wide strips.</li>
        <li><strong>Step 2: </strong> Puree the cilantro, lime zest and juice, ginger, garlic, jalapenos, shallots, fish sauce, brown sugar and 1 tablespoon water in a food processor until smooth, scraping down the processor as needed.</li>
        <li><strong>Step 3: </strong> Heat 3 tablespoons peanut oil in a large skillet over high heat. Add half the cilantro mixture and stir-fry 1 minute. Add the pork and stir-fry until no longer pink, 2 to 3 minutes. Transfer the pork with a slotted spoon to a plate. Add the remaining 1 tablespoon peanut oil to the skillet; add the green beans and stir-fry until tender, 4 to 5 minutes. Add the noodles, pork and 2 tablespoons of the remaining cilantro mixture. Cook, tossing with tongs, until heated through, about 2 minutes. Stir in the remaining cilantro mixture to taste.</li>
